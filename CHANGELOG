##Apricot
* Moved achievement configuration storage to JSON
  * Should automatically convert old config to new
  * No more nasty yaml strings of death, 
  * Makes it easier to keep forwards and backwards compatibility, allowing triggers/rewards to be improved over time without it killing configs.
* Added a fancy html based achievement editor (beta)
  * Tested in firefox and Chrome on windows
  * If you use I.E  and complain, I hope you step on a lego.
  * Held under plugins/BeardAch/editor
  * settings.js is generated by the plugin, and describes
    how to make the UI's for editing the triggers/rewards
  * Support for addon triggers/rewards built into this
* Broke compatability with old addons
  * Breakage needed to enforce changeover
  * Triggers and rewards should use @Expose on fields that
    should be saved. @EditorField is used by the plugin to generate the UI, look to the built in triggers/rewards for examples, and contact me if needs be :)
* Removed help file generation, didn't really work
* Fortify the sql data adapter to try and stop connection loss
causing crashing errors.
* Add command check trigger, this is fired from the commandpreprocessevent (i.e. Before the command is processed)
* New build system for plugin, less work for me to add triggers
  and rewards
